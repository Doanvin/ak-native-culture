## About
This was my first project coming out of a long break from front-end development.  The site is fully responsive at all screen resolutions.  I was trying to use minimal javascript to ensure a quick loading spped so I managed to get the mobile menu working without js.  It was also a last minute project so the scss is a bit sloppy for my taste.  

Also, if you click/tap on one of the images in the past events section a photo gallery will pop up.  I had a thumbnail for each image originally but that caused too many http requests so I changes it to one gallery image.  I will be refactoring the code and implimenting the site into a CMS.  Once they have more content for me to add.
